# Tea Category Frequency

The goal of this project is to determine how frequently each of the six types of tea (From the Camellia sinensis or Camellia sinensis var. assamica plant, aka Chinese and Assam/Indian tea) are mentioned in post titles, post descriptions and comments.

The six main categories of tea are as follows: White, Green, Yellow, Oolong, Black, Dark/Puerh/Pu erh.
Puerh/Pu-erh/Pu erh tea to my knowledge is essentially the de facto sixth category due to its popularity and will be used interchangeably for the purposes of this project.

From my personal experience, the teas that should be the very frequently mentioned should be green and black tea
